	abstract = {Partial digestion of milk proteins leads to the formation of numerous bioactive peptides. Previously, our research team thoroughly examined the decades of existing literature on milk bioactive peptides across species to construct the milk bioactive peptide database (MBPDB). Herein, we provide a comprehensive update to the data within the MBPDB and a review of the current state of research for each functional category from in vitro to animal and clinical studies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitory, opioid, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, calcium absorption and bone health and anticancer activity. This information will help drive future research on the bioactivities of milk peptides.},
