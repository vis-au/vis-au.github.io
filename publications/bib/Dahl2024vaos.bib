	abstract = {Various rheological techniques were applied to study pizza cheese, as a model anisotropic material. Small Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (SAOS) was combined with Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) rheology, and the data compared to large deformation tests and confocal microscopy. Pizza cheese was analyzed at various stages of processing: before/during mixing, freshly stretched and after 1 and 2 weeks of storage. Directional sampling and testing were of critical importance for data interpretation. LAOS data were evaluated using a recently developed software that, with visual interactive analysis, including layover plots and similarity maps, allowed to provide a rheological fingerprint of the cheese's process and storage-induced structural changes. This work demonstrated that by using complementary rheological and microstructural techniques it is possible to improve our understanding of the anisotropy at different length scales, and to distinguish the differences in the networks among samples after various processing stages.},
