	abstract = {Visual summaries of sequential data are often used to identify common trends at a glance. In this poster, we propose a visualization technique to fingerprint sequential data by showing the difference between contiguous data points. For each data point in the sequence, we visualize the difference between itself and the last data point as well as the next data point. As an application, we visualized the revision histories of Wikipedia articles to demonstrate the exploratory value of this technique.},
