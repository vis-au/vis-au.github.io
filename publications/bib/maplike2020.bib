	abstract = {Cartographic maps have been shown to provide cognitive benefits when interpreting data in relation to a geographic location. In visualization, the term map-like describes techniques that incorporate characteristics of cartographic maps in their representation of abstract data. However, the field of map-like visualization is vast and currently lacks a clear classification of the existing techniques. Moreover, choosing the right technique to support a particular visualization task is further complicated, as techniques are scattered across different domains, with each considering different characteristics as map-like. In this paper, we give an overview of the literature on map-like visualization and provide a hierarchical classification of existing techniques along two general perspectives: imitation and schematization of cartographic maps. Each perspective is further divided into four principal categories that group common map-like techniques along the visual primitives they affect. We further discuss this classification from a task-centered view and highlight open research questions.},
