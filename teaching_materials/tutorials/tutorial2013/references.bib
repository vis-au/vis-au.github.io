Additionally, we relate this new layout approach to common layout mechanisms and evaluate the new layout along the lines of a numerical evaluation using the measures of the Ink-Paper-Ratio and overplotted\%, and in a preliminary user study. The flexibility of the general approach is illustrated by several enhancements of the basic layout, as well as its usage within the context of two software frameworks from different application fields.},

However, in certain fields of computer science, graph visualization is understood and focused quite differently. While "graph drawing" focuses on optimized layouts for node-link-representations of networks, "information visualization" prefers to work on hierarchies focusing on very large structures, different views and interactivity. This paper gives a systematic view of the problem of graph visualization by combining both approaches. We introduce a general view of different visualization methods as well as describe occurring problems and discuss basic constraints.

	doi = {10.1109/TVCG.2011.213},
	abstract = {The analysis of large dynamic networks poses a challenge in many fields, ranging from large bot-nets to social networks. As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization– a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown – right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the user's overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.},

However, the origins of graph drawing are not well known. Although Euler (1707-1783) is credited with originating graph theory in 1736 [12],[20], graph drawings were in limited use centuries before Euler’s time. Moreover, Euler himself does not appear to have made significant use of graph visualizations. Widespread use of graph drawing did not begin until decades later, when it arose in several distinct contexts. In this short note we present a selection of very early graph drawings; note the apparent absence of graph visualization in Euler’s work; and identify some early innovators of modern graph drawing.},

	title = {A Survey and Taxonomy of Graph Sampling},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5865},
	abstract = {Graph sampling is a technique to pick a subset of vertices and/ or edges from original graph. It has a wide spectrum of applications, e.g. survey hidden population in sociology [54], visualize social graph [29], scale down Internet {AS} graph [27], graph sparsification [8], etc. In some scenarios, the whole graph is known and the purpose of sampling is to obtain a smaller graph. In other scenarios, the graph is unknown and sampling is regarded as a way to explore the graph. Commonly used techniques are Vertex Sampling, Edge Sampling and Traversal Based Sampling. We provide a taxonomy of different graph sampling objectives and graph sampling approaches. The relations between these approaches are formally argued and a general framework to bridge theoretical analysis and practical implementation is provided. Although being smaller in size, sampled graphs may be similar to original graphs in some way. We are particularly interested in what graph properties are preserved given a sampling procedure. If some properties are preserved, we can estimate them on the sampled graphs, which gives a way to construct efficient estimators. If one algorithm relies on the preserved properties, we can expect that it gives similar output on original and sampled graphs. This leads to a systematic way to accelerate a class of graph algorithms. In this survey, we discuss both classical text-book type properties and some advanced properties. The landscape is tabularized and we see a lot of missing works in this field. Some theoretical studies are collected in this survey and simple extensions are made. Most previous numerical evaluation works come in an ad hoc fashion, i.e. evaluate different type of graphs, different set of properties, and different sampling algorithms. A systematical and neutral evaluation is needed to shed light on further graph sampling studies.},

	doi = {10.1109/TVCG.2013.109},
	abstract = {Large dynamic networks are targets of analysis in many fields. Tracking temporal changes at scale in these networks is challenging due in part to the fact that small changes can be missed or drowned-out by the rest of the network. For static networks, current approaches allow the identification of specific network elements within their context. However, in the case of dynamic networks, the user is left alone with finding salient local network elements and tracking them over time. In this work, we introduce a modular {DoI} specification to flexibly define what salient changes are and to assign them a measure of their importance in a time-varying setting. The specification takes into account neighborhood structure information, numerical attributes of nodes/edges, and their temporal evolution. A tailored visualization of the {DoI} specification complements our approach. Alongside a traditional node-link view of the dynamic network, it serves as an interface for the interactive definition of a {DoI} function. By using it to successively refine and investigate the captured details, it supports the analysis of dynamic networks from an initial view until pinpointing a user's analysis goal. We report on applying our approach to scientific co-authorship networks and give concrete results for the {DBLP} dataset.},

Furthermore, users accessing large graph databases through an online connection or users running on less powerful (mobile) hardware simply do not have the resources needed to compute these overviews. In this paper, we advocate an interaction model that allows users to remotely browse the immediate context graph around a specific node of interest. We show how Furnas' original degree of interest function can be adapted from trees to graphs and how we can use this metric to extract useful contextual subgraphs, control the complexity of the generated visualization and direct users to interesting datapoints in the context.

We illustrate this process in two case studies with domain experts working with legal precedents and food webs. Guidelines for designing substrates are provided, including how to locate, size, and align regions in a substrate, which attributes to choose for grouping nodes into regions, how to select placement methods and which attributes to set as parameters of the selected placement method.

The basic idea is to allow the analyst to optimize the degree of overlap and distortion to generate the best-possible view. To allow an effective usage, we provide the capability to zoom smoothly between the traditional and our generalized scatter plots. We identify an optimization function that takes overlap and distortion of the visualization into account. We evaluate the generalized scatter plots according to this optimization function, and show that there usually exists an optimal compromise between overlap and distortion. Our generalized scatter plots have been applied successfully to a number of real-world {IT} services applications, such as server performance monitoring, telephone service usage analysis and financial data, demonstrating the benefits of the generalized scatter plots over traditional ones.},
